* I have confirmed that the sites form working, only email is accepting.

# Bugs

* when I deployed my project on GITHUB I saw that my images didnt load, this is how it first looked **/assets/images/blala.jpg** and what I did was that I changed the first with adding ### so it looked like this **./assets/images/blala.jpg**.
* Second one was to many unnecessary SE/Meta tags, that was unrelative for the site and didnt fill any purpose.

Also credits to everyone who helped me with this, it was hard since i had other things in the same time but one thing in a time is enough.


# Other information

* Since this is my first project and my first site, I think it's hard atleast for me. since I have ADHD it can be hard with the concentrating, and your focus always ends on something else. What I did to make something usefull with this.
I played some games like [CssBattle](https://cssbattle.devÂ´) & [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/). And I found them more useful then watching a video since it can get boring overtime.

* Be aware aswell that I ive been working in other programs than this for this project like Sublime and Virtual studio code. So I submitted here when the project was done.
